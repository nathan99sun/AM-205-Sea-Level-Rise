This repository was created to implement a numerical algorithm to determine the effects of ice sheet melt on sea level rise motivated by Kendall, Mitrovica, and Milne (2005).

Main files include SLR_CLEAN.ipynb (the main file) and the plots folder, which contain all plots generated. The data file contains all the data loaded.
